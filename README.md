# Happie Signup Client

This application allows members of Happietaria Rotterdam to manage volunteer signups. Happietaria is a non-profit pup up restaurant run by students in different cities in the Netherlands.

Happie Signup also has an client app which allows volunteers to register. It's in its own [repo](https://github.com/weirdwater/happie-signup-client).

# Running the Signup Client

To run the signup client you will need a firebase api key. Make a copy of the `config.example.js` in the `src` directory, rename it to `config.js` and enter your firebase credentials.
